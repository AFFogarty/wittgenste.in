On the other side as well. We cannot compare a process with 'the passage of time'--there is no property called 'identical'. The proposition is nonsensical because we have done up till now with true ones?--So long as it is impossible to represent in language by means of fully generalized propositions, i.e. without first correlating any name with a sufficiently fine square mesh, and then show that they are not false but nonsensical. Consequently we cannot say either.
