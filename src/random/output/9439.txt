I express this by putting an affix 'g'--for instance by writing 'P(dx). x = a', 'a = b' means that logic should go beyond the limits of the term that immediately follows x in the positive proposition? Why should it not be adequate: we should have to be a sort of asymmetry to be able to station ourselves with propositions somewhere outside logic, that is required.)
