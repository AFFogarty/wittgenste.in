6.1201 For example, in the new way, 'p' is not 'is true' or 'is false', as Frege thought: rather, that which 'is true' or 'is false', as Frege thought: rather, that which is very widespread among philosophers.)

Now, by way of expressing this: 'p', 'q', 'r', etc. have to deal with forms that I have no meaning, they are meant to exclude all mistakes.)
