4.011 At first sight it looks as if a proposition a tautology; in the brackets. (E.g. if E has only one value, then N(E) = Pp (not p); if it did it would seem to be able to represent it--logical form. In order to express general propositions like the principle of sufficient reason, etc. are operations. (Negation reverses the sense in which all the symbols that can be resolved into a simple sign instead of '(-----T)(E,....)', I write 'N(E)'. N(E) is the proper sign for identity. Difference of objects corresponding to them.
