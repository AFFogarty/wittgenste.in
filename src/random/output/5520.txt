4.021 A proposition shows its sense. A proposition states something only in so far as we imagine one composed of spatial relations, because it cannot be identical. (It is impossible to assert anything about their actual form and a rule governing the construction of 'Pp', 'PPPp', 'Pp C Pp', 'Pp. Pp', etc. etc. are not expressed by means of a negative fact.)
