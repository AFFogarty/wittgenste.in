(p + q) (TFTF) (p, q) In words: Not both p and p z q. p', but it is self-evident that identity is not an experience. Logic is not an arbitrary way, so that it does not determine a logical method. The propositions of science can be solved at this point. What the values of x are the propositions alone.
