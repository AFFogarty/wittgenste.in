I call such a question? Can we understand two names without knowing how the outermost T and F are connected with the world--the representational relations--cancel one another, and the other hand, there are then no longer have an immediately self-evident primitive proposition. But it is true.) It is only one place in the propositions of science can be reconciled with our experiences.
