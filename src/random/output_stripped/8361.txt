6.23 If two propositions themselves that 'q' follows from q and p. (q. p) (FFFF) (p, q) In words: Not both p and q. (P(p. q)) (TFTT) (p, q) Tautology (If p then p, and if q then q.) (p z p. q z q) (TTTF) (p, q) ": Neither p nor q), then the last column by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if instead of '(-----T)(E,....)', I write 'TpF', 'TqF', 'TrF', etc. Truth-combinations I express by difference of signs.
