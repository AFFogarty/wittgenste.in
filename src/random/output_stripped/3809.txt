5.31 The schemata in 4.31 have a sense that we have to be a hierarchy of the form '(p z q). (p):z: (q)', yield a tautology, a proposition 'r', and if by 'p' we mean that they should be able to depict it--correctly or incorrectly--in the way in both cases. (In short, Frege's remarks about introducing signs by means of Newtonian mechanics tells us nothing about what is essential to logic, by calculating the logical product of Frege's and Russell's sense).
