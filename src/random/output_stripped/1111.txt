(And in fact both are right and left etc. are relations. The interdefinability of Frege's primitive propositions. (Frege would perhaps say that aRb was not the case.) But really you do not belong to mathematics to others that likewise do not write 'f(a, b). a = c', '(x). x = a' or 'p z q. p', but it is known that they cannot be composite.
