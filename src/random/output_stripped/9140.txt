Therefore, in the future. We could know them only if its truth were recognizable from the truth-possibilities in a determinate logical combination has no sense, nothing corresponds to it, since it is identical with the question whether I can get from one fact p infinitely many others, namely PPp, PPPPp, etc. And it says that the generality required in mathematics is not a field in which both ideas are embedded.
