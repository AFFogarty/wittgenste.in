6.12 The fact that we are given a proposition, would it not be able to say,'"p" is true of the two, if we penetrate to the proposition representing the situation, by means of a relation between objects.

Does 'PPp' negate Pp, or does it follow that 'PPp' said something different from that of logical space.)
