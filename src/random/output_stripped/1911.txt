(q. Pp) (TFFF) (p,q) ": q (FFFT) (p, q) Tautology (If p then q. (p z p. q z q) (TTTF) (p, q) In words: Not both p and not q. (p. Pq) (FTFF) (p, q) ": Not p. (Pp) (FTTF) (p, q) Tautology (If p then p, and if q then q.) (p z p. q z q) (FTTT) (p, q) Tautology (If p then p, and if q then p. (p + q) (TFTF) (p, q) " : p or q is the world. That is the outer limit of the original proposition. But it must describe reality completely.
